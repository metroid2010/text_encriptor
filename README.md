# text_encriptor
A simple, joke-intended plain text encriptor

Do not take this too seriously. Not inteded for actual use. Educational purposes only.

Instructions of use: place plain text file (.txt) to encrypt in same directory as the program.
To encrypt, launch 'enc.exe' and input file name. Output file will be in that same folder, named
'enc.txt'. To decrypt, launch 'desenc.exe' and follow same procedure. Final file name will be
'desenc.txt'.


Note: keyword was chosen randomly. I, by any means, do not endorse childish behaviour, unless the case
proves completely imperative (such as making programming fun).

Enjoy!
